# SQL Project – Adventureworks**

This project involves using SQL to solve business problems based on the Adventureworks dataset. Below are the details of the project:

**Database:** The project uses the **Adventureworks dataset**, a practical dataset covering various aspects, including Sales, Products, Employees, Territory, and Customers, among others. A **database diagram** is provided for a better understanding of the data. You can access the data from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18L_yLy08RbhVNIv7TeRktZpBQ95IirKx/view?usp=sharing)


# Problem Statement:** The project involves solving seven business problem statements by writing SQL queries. The output data from these queries will be used to create charts. Here's an overview of the problem statements:

1. **What are the top 10 highest selling products in the database?**
   - Use the `salesorderdetail` table as the base table, with `LineTotal` as Sales. Create a Pie chart to depict this information.

2. **Who are the top 10 highest spending customers in the data along with their address and address type information?**
   - Use the `salesorderheader` table as the base table, with `TotalDue` as sales. Create a Bar chart to depict this information.

3. **Calculate the Sales by Sales Reason Name and Reason Type. Also find the best and worst performing Sales Reason in terms of Sales.**
   - Use the `salesorderheader` table as the base table, with `TotalDue` as sales. Create a Bar chart to depict this information.

4. **Calculate the average number of orders shipped by different Ship methods for each month and year.**
   - Use the `salesorderheader` table as the base table, with `TotalDue` as sales. Create a Line chart to depict this information.

5. **Calculate the count of orders, maximum and minimum shipped by different Credit Card Type for each month and year.**
   - Create a chart of your choice to depict this information.

6. **Which are the top 3 highest selling Sales Person by Territory for each month and year?**
   - Create a chart of your choice to depict this information.

7. **Calculate the count of employees and average tenure per department name and department group name.**
   - Create a table to depict this information.

# Deliverables: The project requires you to prepare the following deliverables:

1. **SQL query file:** This file should include the SQL queries used to generate the data to solve each problem statement.
2. **Presentation:** Create a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation. For each problem statement, add a slide that includes a summary and a chart format displaying the data findings. You can build the charts directly on the slide or use Excel/Google Sheets. Each slide should provide a few points on the findings from the data and a chart depicting the output.
